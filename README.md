## Development 
* [Strategy](#strategy)

To get started, before I write any code, I loaded up index.html from the starter project to see how things look! I noticed that the design.js file was implemented in the <body> tag in the index.html file. My goal was to build out the design.js file to achieve all the interactive elements on the page!
For more details on instructions visit [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me) for the project.
  
Now, I open up design.js. As I started writing my code, I kept these three tasks in mind:
Defining my variables by selecting the DOM elements that the user will interact with. This is where my jQuery skills can come into play! For instance, on the submit button, the table, and the color picker needed to be accessed. The value of the color selected needs to be stored as well, since the clicked cell in the table needs to be set to the selected color.

I added event listeners to the relevant DOM elements, so that user input can be color values and table sizes can be dynamically set by the user.

I set the size of the cross stitch canvas as an N by M grid with the makeGrid() function. I use my knowledge of JavaScript loops to dynamically clear and create the table based on user input. Each cell will have an event listener that sets the background color of the cell to the selected color.
I now tested it by the time I finished, I notice that I was been able to create a canvas of any size, choose a color using the color picker, and click on the canvas's table cells to set their color.

Thank you for your time.
